# Frontend Test-Driven Development Example Project - RSS Feed Reader

This project is an example of test-driven development using the Jasmine framework. The application loads mulitple RSS feeds while the Jasmine tests ensure that everything works appropriately. Tests are ran to ensure that the RSS feeds are defined and not empty, that a name and URL is present for each feed, that the menu of the application is hidden by default and that the class used to hide the menu is toggled when the menu icon is clicked. Tests are also performed to ensure that the asynchronous functions of the application work as intended, with data successfully loading and updating the page content asynchronously.


## Installation

To try the application clone this directory and open the `index.html` file from the project's root folder, using your favourite web browser. At the bottom of the webpage you will see the results of the Jasmine tests.


## Contributing

The initial commit is code provided by Udacity as part of their Frontend Web Development Nanodegree course. All subsequent code was written by Luke Scales to complete the project.
